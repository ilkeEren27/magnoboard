# 🧲 **Project Name:** MagnoBoard

## 🧠 **Inspiration**

Remember those old magnetic drawing boards where you’d drag a stylus and the tiny beads would rise to form lines?

MagnoBoard brings that nostalgic feeling to life, but digitally.

The theme of this year’s hackathon is childhood imagination, and I wanted to build something that captures the  *joy of creating without limits* .

No logins, no complexity, just a digital toy that lets anyone doodle freely, like we did as kids.

## 💡 **What it Does**

MagnoBoard is an online playground where users can:

* Draw with a digital “magnetic pen.”
* Shake or clear the board with a button animation (like flipping the toy upside down).
* Save or share their creations.
* Get random *drawing prompts* powered by AI, like “Draw your favorite toy” or “What did you want to be when you grew up?”

It’s simple, creative, and relaxing, the kind of app that makes your inner child proud.

## ⚙️ AI & Internet Usage Disclosure

**AI & External Resources**

During development, I used documentation (Next.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, MagicUI and react-sketh-canvas) and community resources (Stack Overflow, MDN).

I also used AI tools (ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot) for debugging help, UI suggestions, and boilerplate generation.

All design decisions, core logic, and final implementation were done and verified by me.
